Code originally used in the Pro_mtabs project ([link here](https://github.com/KujawinskiLaboratory/Pro_mtabs)), and updated for work with the metabolites in the Sargasso Sea. Some specific notes follow.
1. There are two metabolites that are not in KEGG (n-acetyltaurine and chitotriose).
2. Extraction efficiency information from Johnson et al. ([2017](https://doi.org/10.1002/lom3.10181)), and supplemented with unpublished data from the Kujawinski lab.
